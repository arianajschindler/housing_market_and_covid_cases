# housing_market_and_covid_cases

I am really interested in the current housing market and its association with covid-19 cases. I want to explore what this looks like across varying locations and not just nation-wide. To dive into this, I found data on the housing index for each state and the US as a whole over the last 20 years and average 30- and 15-year mortgage rates through the Economic Research Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Through FRED, I also found monthly employment cost index, minimum wage rates, unemployment rates, population, layoffs and discharges, hires, and initial claims. I also found applicable covid-19 cases data through Our World In Data (and am still looking for vaccine rate and testing data). None of this data is aggregated and some data sources have been measured for different time intervals so I am currently working on creating a master dataset with all of the variables together.
